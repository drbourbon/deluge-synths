# Deluge Synth Presets

### A collection of synth presets for the Synthstrom Deluge. These presets use the intermal oscillators only - no samples are used. Each preset is a simple XML file.

## Installation
1. [Download this repository as a zip file](https://github.com/weavermedia/deluge-synths/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
2. Unzip the contents
3. Optionally rename the required synth XML files (see below)
3. Copy the XML files to the SYNTHS folder on your Deluge SD card

**Note**: you do not have to copy entire folders of XML files. You can pick and choose any presets you like. This helps to keep your SD card SYNTHS folder light and preset browsing fast on the Deluge.

## Renaming XML files

To avoid possible conflicts with existing synths on your SD I recommend you rename the XML files before copying. I use a prefix before each name to allow for easy browsing and loading.

For example, `11-STRINGS1.XML` from 'Juno60-FactoryGroupA' becomes `J60A-11-STRINGS1.XML`

Use the naming system makes the most sense to you.

## Preset Notes

### Roland Juno 60 - Factory Group A

These presets were ported from the TAL U-NO-LX. Some are very close to the original (the simpler sounds) and others vary in accuracy. Feel free to tweak and send me improvements!
- Some presets are missing (71, 72, 73, 75, 76) due to them using filter self-oscillation.
- Some sound different because they use all 3 oscillator waveforms (Square/Saw/Sub).
- Presets that use the Juno chorus are ported pre-chorus then Deluge chorus/reverb added.
